IVAO CZ ESUP

Squak assigner for IVAO Network, Hardcoded for LKAA airspace.
This utility is not syncing between launched instances and works with whazzup file, hard coded to reload each 1 minute.

SQ banks are coded in globals.cs

As IVAO added server side SQ assigments, this application remain in maintenance mode. Changes upon personal request.


Feel free to rework for your needs if interested :)
